## üîç Detailed Description

### Project Purpose and Scope

This project was developed to visualize virtual wealth and simulate how users can spend this wealth. Users can buy, sell, and manage their cart with various products using a 100 billion dollar starting balance.

### Technical Details

#### App.jsx - Main Application Component

**App.jsx** file is the main component of the application and contains the following important functions:

1. **Context Provider Integration**: 
   - Balance and cart management is provided to the entire application through `MoneyProvider` component
   - This way, each component doesn't have to do prop drilling separately

2. **Routing Structure**:
   - Page redirects are made using React Router
   - Home page (`/`), products page (`/products/:page`), and cart page (`/cart`) routes are defined
   - Pagination operation is supported with URL parameters

3. **Layout Structure**:
   - Products and cart components are placed side by side
   - Responsive layout is achieved using CSS Grid

4. **Font Awesome Integration**:
   - Font Awesome icons are loaded dynamically using `useEffect` hook
   - Memory leaks are prevented with cleanup function

5. **Sub Components**:
   - `MoneyDisplay`: Special component for balance display
   - `ProductsPageWrapper`: Wrapper component that processes URL parameters for products page

#### User Experience Improvements
- **Hold Feature**: Hold feature is added to buy/sell buttons to enable users to make quick transactions.
- **Visual Feedback**: Visual feedback is provided when buttons are clicked, products are added or removed, improving user experience.

#### Responsive Design
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox**: CSS Grid and Flexbox are used for page layout to achieve a design compatible with different screen sizes.
- **Media Queries**: Special style definitions are made for different screen sizes to ensure smooth operation on mobile devices as well.

### Future Developments

- **Local Storage**: Storing cart and balance information in browser local storage
- **Category Filtering**: Filtering products by categories
- **Search Feature**: Ability to search in products
- **Favorite Products**: Saving favorite products and quick access
- **Statistics**: Spending statistics and graphs
